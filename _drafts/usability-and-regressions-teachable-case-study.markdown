title: Usability and Regressions - Teachable Case Study (Part 1/2)
---

Ok.

One thing that irks me is when an animation doesn't match the behavior after the animation.

I'm currently using Teachable for my online courses, and I've been using it for a long time (back when it was called Fedora).

## Software Bugs
One of the things I hate about switching platforms or using something different is the amount of bugs.

I've submitted so many bugs to Teachable (Fedora), and many have been fixed . . . which has been great.

The reason I don't jump ship is that I know that every other platform has it's own quirks and bugs.

I used to use Skillshare and I reported numerous bugs there as well . . . but it didn't give me the control I needed, so I switched to Udemy (after they screwed me on pricing) and then to Fedora (after Udemy screwed me on pricing).

I want to love Teachable, but as with any piece of software it's full of bugs.

## The Details Matter

One thing that's really improtat are the details . . . and for some reason most developers don't pick up on this.

I'm not sure if this an education gap, or if they just need to experience using buggy software.

I really do think it comes down to using the software you create.

If you dont' use it, if you don't watch people use, it and if you don't get feedback from people, you're going to be building software that's not loved.

When you create an app you need to think about all the edge cases, and I'll admit I even fail here . . .

But that's why you beta test, and that's why you release v1.0 products and then iterate.

## Apple Iterates a Ton

Apple didn't launch a perfect product on day one, in fact they've messed up numerous times with both software and hardware launches.

But what they did do is they iterated.

They created something, got feedback, and fixed it.

No one's perfect, but when you set the bar high, people expect more from you.

## Recently I Launched a new Beta Test

I practice what I preach by creating software that I can use, and then getting feedback.

We had 4 different people do a usabilty test before we kicked off our beta test of Super Easy Timer.

Watching 4 peopel use our software helped us solve a lot of problems we just didn't see in our own tunnel vision.

But that wasn't enough.

We need to get feedback from people who actually do want to use our software.

So we put a call to beta testers on my blog, YouTube, and my email list.

From that we had over 130+ people interested and then over 90+ signed up to beta test.

Already from the first day of feedback we've fixed a ton of bugs, and started documented unexpected behaviors (to the customer), or new feature requests for enhancements.

One thing that helped a ton was to see how people used the app. Just watching someone else provide commentary as they try to use your software is priceless. Checkout http://UseLoom.com if you want a painless way for people to quickly record and send a video of their first time experience with your Mac app (or website).

If it's an iPhone app, you'll need them to plugin their iPhone and use QuickTime to preview it on screen while they make a screen recording.

## Back to reporting bugs and ... Teachable


Recently I found a regression in the way the curriculm editor works . . . and it's driving me insane.

Usability is a huge concern of mine, and the thing that irritates me the most are bad bug reporting policies and people telling me that it's not a bug.

The user is never wrong.

If they are confused, there is clearly something wrong.

If they feel frustrated, there is clearly something wrong.

If they can't get work done, or are taken out of the zone then clearly something is wrong.

There's two issues I have with Teachable right now as a software provider.

## 1. The new bug policy makes no sense to me

I'll spend a good 10-20 minutes reporting a bug, and then shortly after I get an email that my bugs automatically being closed.

That's irritating. 

Not only does it show me that you don't appreciate my time, but it makes me feel like you don't care.

I get it that you might get a lot of bug reports, but an autoclose policy without action on my part doesn't make any sense.

I took the action to submit the bug, why are you automatically closing it.

## 2. The support team is telling me it's not a bug

I can't stand it when the support team doesn't actually use the product.

Or doesn't take a suggestion for a feature request.

This is one of the reasons that developers need to use the products they create.

If you don't use the product, you don't understand the frustrations of your users.

Going back an forth on whether somethign is a bug seems trivail, but it has deeper implications.

A company that is out of touch with how their product is being used means they don't get it.
