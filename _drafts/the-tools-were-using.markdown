## The Tools We're Using

We're currently using the following tools and process to track our progress, work together, and polish up the next version of the beta test.

* Github
    * GitFlow (branches for features and bug fixes)
    * Code reviews 
* Manuscript.com 
    * Bug tracking, free for 2 people
* Sketch
    * Graphic design
* Principle
    * Animation prototyping


Throughout the process we're using GitFlow to work on new features, and then merging those features back into our main development branch.

After this new bug fix branch gets merged back in, we'll have a new build to release and tag in our GitHub repository. Then we'll cut a build, and share it with our beta testers.

None of this would be possible if we weren't using a press process on GitHub with GitFlow, code reviews, discussions, and tracking bugs/features with Manuscript.

I'd love to share more of the details about how we're managing this project. If you're interested in more. Reply below, or send me an email at Paul@SuperEasyApps.com
