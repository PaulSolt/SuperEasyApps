### I couldn't make iPhone apps or coffee without these tools!


Here are 181 tools that I use on a daily basis to write Swift code, research API changes, design UI, edit graphics, write articles, take notes, and record videos with high quality audio.

iOS apps are multimedia productions and they require more than just code. I leverage YouTube to teach my customers, build an audience for my apps, and promote my apps (along with online tutorials).

Getting things done is super important when you work on iOS app development as a hobby, or even as a career. Taking notes, reviewing notes, and following up with people I meet are all  incredibly important.

I'm including all of the tools that I use on a daily basis, since there's a lot of overlap between making iOS apps and making high quality videos—as you market your own apps (and your portfolio).

Many of the links below are available on Amazon with affiliate links. Any purchase you make help support Super Easy Apps, so that I can keep making online tutorials. For your ideal home office, don't buy your desk chair's through Amazon—you can get better deals locally!

## Mobile Office (i.e. Daily Backpack) <a id="mobileoffice"></a>

Being mobile is extremely important ever since I bought my first MacBook Pro in 2007 before working at Apple. I travel almost everywhere with my bag, MacBook Pro, iPad, frisbee, pour-over coffee, and a Moleskine notebook. Everything fits nicely in my North Face Recon backpack—I get a workout from carrying so much weight.

## Pockets <a id="pockets"></a>

My pockets are never empty. The iPhone 6S+ is still my goto iPhone, but I'm looking forward to an iPhone X in the near feature, along with an updated Apple Watch. The AirPods addition has been amazing for my long runs and walks where I listen to dozens of audio books on [Audible](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/audible-audio-books-podcasts/id379693831?mt=8) and podcasts with [Breaker](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/breaker-podcast-app/id1215095006?mt=8).

1. [iPhone 6S+](https://amzn.to/2MpGACg) - I need to upgrade to an iPhone X (recently had 6S+ battery replaced)

## iOS Development and Productivity Tools <a id="iosdevelopmenttools"></a>

Throughout the day I use a ton of tools, but the most important are Xcode, Multimarkdown, Github, and Evernote. With these tools I can brainstorm new ideas, take notes, and create new apps from scratch. My productivity is enhanced with utilities like TextExpander, Gmail shortcuts, PasteBot, Things, and 1Password. I manage projects with paper, Google Sheets, Manuscript, and Basecamp.

## iOS Design Tools <a id="iosdesigntools"></a>

Sketch has changed my iOS app design world. It's much more user friendly than Photoshop or Illustrator and allows me to quickly create assets for iPhone/iPad resolutions (1x, 2x, 3x). IconKit saves me time exporting icon sizes for my app icons, and paper is still my go-to brain storming tool with mind maps, sketches, and concepts.

5. Printer paper
6. Whiteboard

## Daily iOS Apps <a id="dailyiosapps"></a>

These are the apps that I use on a daily or weekly basis. Two of the apps are mine, and the rest are apps that I don't think I could live without and accomplish as much as I do. Health and fitness are important to me, ever since I dropped from 184 pounds down to 130 pounds. I am constantly learning on my walks and runs with podcasts and audio books, most of the time at 1.5x to 2x speeds.

<script async id="_ck_413106" src="https://forms.convertkit.com/413106?v=7"></script>

## Terminal Tools <a id="terminaltools"></a>

As you work with apps you'll need to learn how to use the Terminal. These are my primary tools that I work with on Terminal, along with many other little utilities that you'd find in a command-line textbook. I still prefer to use git on the command line for no-fast-forward merges (so I can see the branches in SourceTree), plus it re-enforces the commands so I don't forget them.

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com) - Version control software for doing GitFlow merges (no fast forward)

		git merge --no-ff --no-commit FeatureBranchName

	1. [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) - A process for using Git on a team

<script async id="_ck_413106" src="https://forms.convertkit.com/413106?v=7"></script>

## Apple Adapters (Almost All Travel With Me in My Backpack) <a id="appleadapters"></a>

It would be nice to not need adapters, but we're still in a world with many different connectors. Until all adapters unify to something like USB-C (hopefully more flexible), I'm going to be carrying these adapters every where I go in my backpack.

1. 2x [Apple USB-C to HDMI Digital AV Multiport Adapter](https://amzn.to/2MpcrD7) - For USB-C Power, HDMI, Logitech G502 Mouse, and projectors

<script async id="_ck_413106" src="https://forms.convertkit.com/413106?v=7"></script>

## Home Office <a id="homeoffice"></a>

My home office has an awesome retina 5K monitor along with the newest Apple Keyboard and Magic TrackPad 2. I always dual wield a trackpad on my left hand and a wired mouse on my right hand. 

1. [LG UltraFine 27 inch 5K Monitor](https://amzn.to/2t3c1JF) - Gorgeous retina display, but less user friendly compared to Thunderbolt 27" (Looking forward to new Apple displays)
2. [Logitech G502 Wired Mouse](https://amzn.to/2JJzFlB) - Great, comfortable wired mouse for Xcode, Sketch UI design, and games (downside: cable frays and fabric needs to be cut to prevent crimping)

### Home Desk <a id="homedesk"></a> ###

The IKEA desk is what I've used since I started my 2nd year at RIT. It's a great desk and the Embody chair is a great chair. The footrest helps, since I'm short and improves my posture.

1. IKEA Jerker (Discontinued) - Great configurable desk with lots of depth
2. [Herman Miller Embody Chair](https://amzn.to/2y8rtdi) - Good office chair, less customizability than my work office chair below (Best price through local distributor)
3. [Kensington Footrest](https://amzn.to/2MnIMtN) - Best footrest for desk posture (you need firm, not squishy, and no wheels!)

<script async id="_ck_413106" src="https://forms.convertkit.com/413106?v=7"></script>

## Pour Over Coffee (I'm a Coffee Snob) <a id="pourovercoffee"></a>

I'll admit that I'm a coffee snob. I've been hooked ever since one of my friends introduced me to Hario V60. Having an amazing local coffee roaster, [Joe Bean Coffee Roasters](http://www.joebeanroasters.com), has made coffee a daily ritual. I am working to improve the home brewing experience with my Brew Coffee recipe app. It's been a four year journey into coffee, and I'm excited to launch the app in the coming year after all my research.

1. [Brew Coffee app (Invite only beta for iPhone)](http://BrewCoffeeApp.com) - My upcoming recipe app for Chemex and Hario V60

## Work Office <a id="workoffice"></a>

I'm still using and loving my Thunderbolt 27" monitor. I wish Apple actually made the 5K monitor (which is in the works) instead of LG, since the Thunderbolt is very reliable. Before my 2016 MacBook Pro, my 2013 Mac Pro was my goto video editing and streaming Mac. The ThunderBay provides my video backups and is super fast in a RAID array.

![Standing-Desk-iOS-Developer-Mac](/content/images/2018/06/Standing-Desk-iOS-Developer-Mac.jpeg#full)

1. [Thunderbolt 27" Display](https://amzn.to/2y4syTo) - My work office display (unfortunately it's still non-retina)

9. [Logitech G502 Wired Mouse](https://amzn.to/2MoKSto) - Great, comfortable wired mouse for Xcode, Sketch UI design, and games (downside: cable frays and fabric needs to be cut to prevent crimping)
10. [Razer Mousepad](https://amzn.to/2t3cc7N) - Good mousepad
11. [Airport Extreme (5th Generation)](https://amzn.to/2t26V03) - Apple discontinued, but mine still works

### Work Desk <a id="workdesk"></a>

I love my office because it's a space away from home that I've been able to record my videos, write articles, and create iPhone apps. I use a standing desk that is motorized, which allows me to sit and stand throughout the day. More importantly, I like to stand while recording screencasts. The Very Task Chair is excellent, I enjoy it more than the Embody, largely due to the ability to pull-in closer to my desk with it's customizable arm rests.

1. [UpDesk Motorized Standing Desk (Large 72" x 30")](https://updesk.com/products/pro) - Standing during recordings and on/off during workday
2. [Haworth Very Task Chair](https://amzn.to/2t1YYYR) - Best office chair with lots of customizability (Better than Embody, buy through local distributor for best price)
3. [Herman Miller Embody Chair](https://amzn.to/2y8rtdi) - Good office chair, less customizability (Best price through local distributor)
4. [Kensington Footrest](https://amzn.to/2MnIMtN) - Best footrest (you need firm, not squishy, and no wheels!)
